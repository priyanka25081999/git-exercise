Git Hooks:
1. Git hooks allows us to run custom scripts whenever any important events occur in the git-lifecycle such as commiting, merging and pushing.
2. Pre-commit, Pre-push hooks and many other hooks are there.
3. We can find hook directory inside .git folder. If we want to execute any hook, then first we need to remove the .sample extension from the respective file
then we need to make it executable and finally we can run the hooks.

Example:
1. During git commit if we have set the pre-commit hook and if we pass incorrect username or email, then pre-commit hook will throw an error by saying 
username or email is incorrect. It helps us to avoid such mistakes and increase productivity
